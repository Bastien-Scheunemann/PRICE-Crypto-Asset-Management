# Portfolio Backtesting with Animated Visualization

This code is a backtesting framework for a portfolio management strategy using historical price data of several cryptocurrencies. It defines a Portfolio class to model the portfolio and manage various assets, and an Asset class to represent individual assets and their associated functions for analysis and trading strategies. The backtesting process is performed over a specified time period, and the results are visualized using an animated plot.

# How to Use

Ensure you have all the necessary packages installed. Some of them might need to be installed first using pip, such as ta, yfinance, and tabulate.
Run the code in a Python environment that supports plotting, such as Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.
The code starts by fetching historical price data for specified cryptocurrencies using Yahoo Finance (yfinance library).
It then defines the Asset class with various functions for calculating technical indicators and trading strategies. The Asset class is used by the Portfolio class to manage a collection of assets.
The Portfolio class includes functions for adding assets, updating asset prices, removing assets based on trading strategies (take profit and stop-loss), and calculating portfolio performance and risk.
The app function is the heart of the backtesting strategy, where assets are added or removed based on specified trading strategies.
The animated visualization is created using matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation. It shows the evolution of the portfolio's total value, the percentage of each asset in the portfolio, and the risk over time.

# Important Notes

Please note that this backtesting code is provided for educational and illustrative purposes only. The trading strategies used here are simplistic and do not represent actual trading recommendations.
In a real-world scenario, developing and deploying trading strategies requires in-depth knowledge of finance, risk management, and thorough testing before using real money.
The code might require adjustments based on the availability of historical price data and the specific requirements of the trading strategy being tested.
Always exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making any financial decisions or engaging in trading activities.
The backtesting results are purely hypothetical and should not be considered as indicative of actual future performance.
